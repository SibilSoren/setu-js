Welcome to **YantrJS**, the "Shadcn for Backend" CLI designed to accelerate your backend development without sacrificing ownership.

## Why "Yantr"?

"Yantr" (यन्त्र) is the Sanskrit word for **Instrument** or **Machine**. We believe that while AI and automation can build the machine, the developer should always be the one holding the instruments.

## The Philosophy: Ownership over Abstraction

Most backend scaffolders hide their logic behind complex dependencies or high-level abstractions. When you need to customize a core behavior (like how JWTs are handled), you find yourself fighting the framework.

**YantrJS takes a different approach.**

Instead of being a dependency, YantrJS is a **code orchestrator**. It injects high-quality, production-ready TypeScript code directly into your project.

### Key Principles

- **Ownership**: The code is yours. Once it's in your `lib/yantr` folder, you own it. Change it, delete it, or extend it.
- **Zero Bloat**: Only the code you need is added. No massive "base" dependencies that you never use.
- **Type Safety**: Built from the ground up with TypeScript and Zod for robust, self-documenting code.
- **Production-Ready**: Patterns we've battle-tested in real production environments (Pino logging, Prisma singletons, Helmet security).

## Supported Frameworks

YantrJS supports multiple backend frameworks:

- **Express.js** — Classic and flexible (default)
- **Hono** — Ultrafast multi-runtime framework
- **Fastify** — High throughput and low overhead

## Supported Runtimes

- **Node.js** — Standard JavaScript runtime (default)
- **Bun** — Fast all-in-one runtime

## How it Works

1. **`yantr create <name>`**: Creates a new project with an interactive wizard (runtime, framework, database, components)
2. **`yantr init`**: Initializes YantrJS in an existing project
3. **`yantr add`**: Fetches specific components (Auth, DB, etc.) from our registry and places them in your project
4. **`yantr generate`**: Scaffolds repetitive patterns like Routes, Controllers, and Services
